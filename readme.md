# Supabase Auth + Metamask

POC for integration of Metamask as a custom authentication provider for Supabase. Backend creates a new refresh token by writing directly into the _auth_ schema in Supabase database.

This POC can be used as a template for implementation of any custom authentication providers which is not currently supported by Supabase.
